# POSEm

Just a code thay helps you to know the parameters for your analog camera in function of some parameters !

## What is POSEm ? 

POSEm is a tool designed to help you parameter your analog camera, when the only thing you know is the value of the lux. You then choose the way the light was measured, and the speed of your film, and POSEm gives you the speed and aperture you need to choose !

## How do you use POSEm ?

POSEm has a database of cameras, lenses and films, with the speeds and apertures of each. You just have to choose your camera, lens and film, add them to your "collection", you then enter the value of the lux, the way the light was measured, and the program gives you the best combination of both !

## What are the changes to come ?

1. The Python program is in construction.
2. The C program will soon be working, and so will the .exe file.
3. The Web app will soon be working, but without the database.
4. The database will slowly be completed with values for alot of cameras.
5. Implementation of the DB to the website and the Python program.
